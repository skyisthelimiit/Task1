My name ius yash jain.I am from CSE branch in IIt Guwahati.Personally i want to do opensource to contribute something to the geek world.
For instance..There are numerous shortcomings on some famous websites like as on codeforces....
We still can not check large test cases. So we can contri to it by developing some soln to this problem.Somebody would have worked on opensource to introduce the graphing and 
analyticladistribution of ones codeforces profile...which i persobnally found very useful....Also...Have always heard about Gsoc ....And to participate in that ...we should be 
strong at open sources!
Thats it from my side !
